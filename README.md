# Ping Pong Game

A classic ping-pong game built with Python using the Pygame library. Control your paddle, hit the ball, and score points against a simple AI opponent. The game increases in difficulty as your score grows, with "Level Up!" notifications appearing at each new level. Features include an easy restart mechanism and a clean interface.
